# Veos OSRS
[![revision][rev-badge]][patch] [![license][license-badge]][mit] [![chat][discord-badge]][discord]

This project is aimed to be the foundation of an OSRS server. This project primarily serves as a learning experience for me, however I'm aiming to get it to a usable state with some basic content.
A lot of the code will be inspired, and even copied from [OS-S][oss-url] and [RS Mod 2][rsmod-url].

---

**As of right now this server is more or less a direct clone of [RS Mod 2][rsmod-url]. Certain things are named and organized differently, compared to the official.**

### Goal With Project
The goal with this project is to get myself a base/foundation to build my own RSPS project(s) on. At the same time I will also keep the core and some simple content open source, so anyone can contribute or use it freely.
